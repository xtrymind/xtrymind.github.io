On windows explorer when you want to go back to last place you have been, you'd press backspace on keyboard. 

On nautilus or gnome files, they set that shortcut by alt + arrow left, i'd like it to be one key or backspace again, but unfortunatelly nautilus didn't offer to change shortcut. 

To change it to backspace, github user [riclc](https://github.com/riclc) create python extension to [Brings back the Backspace shortcut to Nautilus](https://github.com/riclc/nautilus_backspace) using nautilus python.

```shell_session
users $ sudo pacman -S python2-nautilus
on ubuntu it command apt-get install python-nautilus
```

download ``BackspaceBack.py`` on link above and put it in ``.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/`` and then restart Nautilus ``killall nautilus``
