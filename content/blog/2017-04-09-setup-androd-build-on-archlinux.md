EDIT :
there's dirty trick on arch wiki to fix problem on [venv](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Android#Setting_up_the_build_environment)

Well, there's not much to write here.

arch linux guide on set up android build tool [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Android#Building_Android) is pretty much detailed on how to do it.
but since android still use python2, and arch use python3 by default, you will have a little problem using python2 with venv.

since it's like that, i'm using this trick to set up python2 :

```shell_session
 users $ sudo mkdir /opt/python2
 users $ cd /opt/python2
 users $ sudo ln -s $(which python2) python
```

then put this on build script or paste on current terminal or in .zshrc or .bashrc
```conf
 export PATH="/opt/python2:$PATH"
```
