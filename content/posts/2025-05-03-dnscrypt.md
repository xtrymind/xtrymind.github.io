Due to technical issues in the last few minutes, the dnscrypt-proxy package is not currently available in the default Debian Linux 12 (Bookworm) repositories. However, you can install it from the ‘sid’ with some care. Create a new file as follows:
```
sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sid.list
```

Append the following config:
```
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian sid main
```

Save and close the file. You must configure Pinning to avoid upgrading all packages from Debian Linux unstable (sid) to stable 12 (bookworm) release as follows:
```
Append the following config:
Package: *
Pin: release a=unstable
Pin-Priority: -10
```

Save and close the file. Verify pinning policy and ensures that Debian unstable including dnscrypt-proxy is at -10 priority:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt-cache policy
sudo apt-cache policy dnscrypt-proxy
```

Finally install the package:
```
sudo apt install -t sid dnscrypt-proxy
```

The following settings in /usr/lib/systemd/system/dnscrypt-proxy.socket, let dnscrypt-proxy listen on localhost on port 5053:

```
ListenStream=127.0.0.1:5053
ListenDatagram=127.0.0.1:5053
```

Also edit `/etc/dnscrypt-proxy/dnscrypt-proxy.toml`, updating the following settings:

```
# Use systemd socket activation:
listen_addresses = []

# Populate `server_names` with desired DoH/DNSCrypt upstream DNS servers listed in https://dnscrypt.info/public-servers/.
# Example for Cloudflare malware-blocking DNS:
server_names = ['cloudflare-security']
```

After that configuring Pi-hole

Log into the Pi-hole admin web interface.
Navigate to "Settings" and from there to "DNS".
Under "Upstream DNS Servers", uncheck all boxes for public DNS servers.
Under "Upstream DNS Servers", ensure the box is filled with the IP address and port combination dnscrypt-proxy listens on, such as ```127.0.0.1#5053```.
Click on Save at the bottom.
